Final Exam

The application provides an interface that allows registered companies to create projects and invite relevant clients to the platform. This creates a "room" between the company and the client, facilitating communication, document storage, and customer service processes.

It is a web-based application, accessible to anyone without the need to download anything. Suggested technologies: PHP, HTML5, SQL DB.

The system is divided into two main modules from a logical perspective: Company Module and Client Module.

Feature List

Company Module

A company can register on the platform by filling out the required company information.
Upon company registration, an Admin user is created, who can log in to the application anytime using their email and password.
Users have a "Forgot Password" option, allowing them to reset their password.
After logging in, the admin user sees a "Dashboard" displaying the most relevant information, such as projects, users, and news.
The admin user can invite colleagues to the platform. They will receive an email notification to activate their accounts and log in.
The company admin can create projects by specifying the project name, duration, and selecting relevant team members.
The company admin can send an invitation to a client for an existing project, which creates the "room" between the company and the client.
The project has a news feed section where both company employees and the client can open a specific discussion thread to communicate via comments.
The project allows uploading of necessary documents: contracts, attachments, branding guidelines, quotes, invoices, account statement extracts, and other documents. PDF and image files can be opened with a click, while other documents can be downloaded.
Company employees can view bugs created by the client in a to-do list format, with a status, priority, and an optional deadline.
Company employees can update the status of a task: in progress/completed, etc.
Client Module

The client can activate their account based on the instructions in the email invitation.
After logging in, the client can view the projects they have been added to on the platform.
The client can enter the internal page of a project, where they can access all project-related information, upload and access documents, open new topics, and create tasks.
The client can create new feature requests or bugs within a project, which will appear in a list view for company employees. When a new document is uploaded or a new task is created, the project members receive an email notification.
